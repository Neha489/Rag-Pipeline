      "bolt gets tighter. To be a creative, you have to risk sharing your true self, in public again and\n",
      "again. Using AI doesn't make you creative until you've stood in a room of people to share your ideas\n",
      "and art with your whole heart. \" That's something Saiam Hasan, Assistant Programming Director at\n",
      "Channel 4 Radio Network UAE, is clear about: \"Creativity is to break the clutter, do something\n",
